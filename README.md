     # (Intel Chip)
     $ yarn docker:dev

     # (silicon chip)
     $ yarn docker:dev:arm

     # to build image container
     $ yarn docker:build

   ```

3. Run development server
4. Start coding

```bash
# to install dependencies
$ yarn
# or
$ yarn install
```

## Available commands:

```bash
# to start development server
$ yarn web:dev

# to build production
$ yarn web:build

# to start production server
$ yarn web:run

# --------------------------
# Testing
# --------------------------
# to run test for cms project
$ yarn <target>:test

## User Onboarding

After starting the web app, which will be hosted on 'localhost:6767'. The user will be directed to a landing page, where users can click on the 'Sign In or Login' to get Started.

### Login / Sign Up

The Login and Sign up is the same action in our app, where it takes a certain username and password and then derives a smart wallet for it (ERC4337). If the user is using the platform for the first time, it will save the username to IPFS and a smart wallet is created. The user will then be using the smart wallet to interact with our social scoring systems.

### Linking wallets

One smart wallet entity can be connected to many personal wallets that will contribute to the final score. To link a wallet, Trexx will prompt the user to sign an auth message that will be decrypted by the backend to check for eligibility and then proceed to score calculation.

### Dashboard

The dashboard displays the smart wallet as the main entity and all connected personal wallets will be sub entities that can be viewed in more detail to breakdown how does that entity contribute towards the ending score.
